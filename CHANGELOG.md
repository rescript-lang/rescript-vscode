- Adapt command to create interface files to latest JSX V4 (no key prop, possibly empty record) https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-vscode/issues/617

This is a more fine-grained process for guiding the user to remove dead code one item at a time. https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-vscode/pull/601 https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-vscode/pull/610
  This feature comes from a conversation with @jfmengels on how https://github.com/jfmengels/elm-review is designed.

- Added command `ReScript: Open the compiled JS file for this implementation file.`.
- Use semantic syntax highlighting (https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-vscode/pull/367).
- Report "Fatal error" when it happens in the compiler log (e.g. a make function with type annotation) and don't crash the extension.
