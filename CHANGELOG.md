## v1.4.0

#### :rocket: New Feature

- Add command: ReScript: Restart Language Server
- Extend integration with reanalyze for code analysis. Support both `dce` and `exception` analysis which can be configured to e.g. both run by adding `{"reanalyze": {"analysis": ["dce", "exception"]} }` in `bsconfig.json`.

#### :boom: Breaking Change

- Drop support for `bs-patform`. Only `rescript` supported.

## 1.3.0

- Fix issue where using paths of the form `./something` would show multiple copies of the same file in vscode.
- When hovering on a field access, show the instantiated type of the field.
- Support autocomplete for objects from another module `M.x[...`.
- Fix command for creating interface files when the project uses namespaces.
- Added command `ReScript: Open the compiled JS file for this implementation file.`.
- Use semantic syntax highlighting (https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-vscode/pull/367).
- Report "Fatal error" when it happens in the compiler log (e.g. a make function with type annotation) and don't crash the extension.
- Fix issue in functions the form "~foo as name" where the location would only cover "ame".
- Extend the command to create an interface file, to support components and ReScript decorators used in bindings.
- Enable formatting files without needing the file to be in an actual ReScript project.
- New feature: Show Outline which was previously disabled.
- Add command to quickly switch between implementation and interface file.
- Support hover on JSX props and labelled arguments.

## 1.2.1

- Fix issue with highlighting of interpolation strings (those with backticks) introduced in release 1.2.0.
- Fix crash when the project contains OCaml files that have warnings.
- Fix crash on hover when a dependency contains a type with functor application. This is not expressible in ReScript syntax, but can appear in a dependent OCaml package and be pulled in for processing by the extension.
- Remove obsolete `@bs` snippets

## 1.2.0

Features:

- Add autocompletion for object access of the form `foo["x"]` and `foo["x"]["y"]["z"]`.
- Support autocomplete of records for variables defined in other files.
- Improve autocomplete when several values have the same name, with a heuristic to approximate the correct scope.
- Add a "Dead Code Analysis" mode that will highlight globally dead values, redundant optional arguments, dead modules, dead types (records and variants) ([#334](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-vscode/pull/334))

Fixes:

- Fix issue in JSX autocomplete when the component is declared external.
- Fix jump-to-definition for uncurried calls.
- Fix issue where values for autocomplete were pulled from implementations instead of interfaces.
- Fix issue with autocomplete then punned props are used in JSX. E.g. `<M foo ...>`.
- Fix issue with JSX autocompletion not working after `foo=#variant`.
- Fix issue in JSX autocompletion where the `key` label would always appear.
- Fix issue in record field autocomplete not working with type aliases.
- Fix issue where autocomplete for local values would not work in the presence of `@react.component` annotations.
- Fix issue where the server would crash on large output produced by the binary command.
- Fix issue where the server would crash when a file has a self cycle.

## 1.1.3

Features:

- Find references to files as modules.
- Autocomplete: skip inline comments to decide if a labeled argument was already supplied.
- Rename: support file rename when renaming a module name.
- Rename: use renameProvider to give a warning when it's not a symbol that can be renamed.
- Jump to definition: support jumping to type definition.
- Jump to definition: jump to the `res` file when both `res` and `resi` are present.
- Restore creation of interface files (fully supported from compiler 9.1.3 onwards).

Features:

- Don't show file path on hover and autocomplete (cleaner).
- Autocomplete for props in JSX components.
- `->` autocomplete for built-in list, array, string, option types. And for string and array literals.

## 1.0.6

Fixes:

- Diagnostics crashing when a file's range isn't found (advice: use fewer ppxes that cause these bugs!). See [#77](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-vscode/issues/77).
- Weird behaviors when project path contains white space.
- Proper audit of the windows bugs. Windows is now officially first-class!

Syntax colors:

- Highlight operators for default VSCode dark+ theme. This means slightly less diverse highlight for the other themes that previously already highlighted operators.
- Worked with [One Dark Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme) and [Mariana Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rickynormandeau.mariana-pro). We now officially recommend these 2 themes, in addition to the existing recommendations in README.
