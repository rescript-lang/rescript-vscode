Fixes:

- Jump-to-definition on some Windows paths.
- `->` autocomplete overruled `.`.
- Hover on components in interface files.

Features:

- Show References! Works cross-files too.
- Hover now supports markdown docs.
- Hover on labels in component functions with compiler version 9.1, and labels with type annotation.
- Don't show file path on hover and autocomplete (cleaner).
- Autocomplete for props in JSX components.
- `->` autocomplete for built-in list, array, string, option types. And for string and array literals.
- Slimmer download.

Breakages:

- Very old linux versions are no longer supported.

## 1.0.8

Fixes:

Features:

## 1.0.6

Fixes:

- Diagnostics crashing when a file's range isn't found (advice: use fewer ppxes that cause these bugs!). See [#77](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-vscode/issues/77).
- Weird behaviors when project path contains white space.
- Proper audit of the windows bugs. Windows is now officially first-class!

Syntax colors:

- Highlight operators for default VSCode dark+ theme. This means slightly less diverse highlight for the other themes that previously already highlighted operators.
- Worked with [One Dark Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme) and [Mariana Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rickynormandeau.mariana-pro). We now officially recommend these 2 themes, in addition to the existing recommendations in README.
