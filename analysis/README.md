# Analysis Binary

This subfolder builds a private command line binary used by the plugin to power a few functionalities such as jump to definition, hover and autocomplete.

The binary reads the `.cmt` and `.cmti` files and analyses them.

For installation & build instructions, see the main CONTRIBUTING.md.
